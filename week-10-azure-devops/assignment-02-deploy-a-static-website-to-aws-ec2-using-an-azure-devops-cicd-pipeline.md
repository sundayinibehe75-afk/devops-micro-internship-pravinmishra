# Assignment 2 — Deploy A Static Website to AWS EC2 Using an Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will import and personalize the Static Website, provision and configure an AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and Ansible, and create an Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline that automatically deploys the website to Nginx through an SSH Service Connection.

---

# Task 0 — Verify the Existing Tooling and Self-Hosted Agent

## Goal

Confirm that Terraform, Ansible, AWS CLI, SSH, and the self-hosted Azure Pipelines agent are ready.

No submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 1 — Import and Personalize the Azure Static Website Repository

## Goal

Import the Azure Static Website into Azure Repos and add your Full Name to the website.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 1 — Azure Static Website in Azure Repos

Add a screenshot of Azure Repos showing:

* Imported Azure Static Website repository
* Project files
* `index.html`

# Task 2 — Provision and Configure the Target EC2 Instance

## Goal

Provision the AWS EC2 instance using Terraform and configure Nginx, SSH access, and deployment permissions using Ansible.

No additional submission screenshot is required for this task.

---

# Task 3 — Create the SSH Service Connection

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps SSH Service Connection that can connect to the target EC2 instance using your selected SSH authentication method.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 2 — SSH Service Connection

Add a screenshot of the saved SSH Service Connection **Overview** page showing:

* Service Connection name
* SSH connection type

# Task 4 — Create the Azure DevOps YAML Pipeline

## Goal

Create an Azure DevOps YAML pipeline that deploys the Azure Static Website to the target EC2 instance after a commit is pushed.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 3 — Azure Pipelines YAML

Add a screenshot of `azure-pipelines.yml` open in the Azure Repos editor showing:

* Push trigger
* Selected self-hosted agent pool
* Pipeline variables
* Repository checkout step
* Pipeline information step
* `CopyFilesOverSSH@0` task
* `SSH@0` verification task

# Task 5 — Create, Authorize, and Run the Pipeline

## Goal

Run the Azure DevOps pipeline and confirm that the website files are transferred and verified successfully.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 4 — Successful Pipeline Run

Add a screenshot of the successful pipeline run and log summary showing:

* Overall pipeline status as **Succeeded**
* Pipeline information step completed
* File-copy step completed
* Remote-verification step completed
* Your Full Name visible in the pipeline output

# Task 6 — Verify the Website and Automatic Trigger

## Goal

Confirm that the website is accessible through the EC2 public IP address and that a new pushed commit automatically triggers another deployment.

## Evidence

### Screenshot 5 — Deployed Azure Static Website

Add a browser screenshot showing:

* Deployed Azure Static Website
* EC2 public IP address in the browser address bar
* Your Full Name
* Updated website content after the automatic deployment

# Assignment Summary

Write a short summary of the completed CI/CD workflow.

I built an end-to-end CI/CD workflow for a static website. Using Terraform, I provisioned an AWS EC2 instance as the deployment target. With Ansible, I installed and configured Nginx on it and prepared the ubuntu user for deployments. I also used Ansible to install and register a second self-hosted Azure Pipelines agent on my existing agent VM, in a new pool called StaticSiteAgentPool, with the PAT stored securely in an Ansible Vault-encrypted file. In Azure DevOps, I created an SSH service connection to the web VM and a YAML pipeline that triggers on every commit to main. The pipeline runs on the self-hosted agent, copies the site files to /var/www/html over SSH, and verifies the deployment with a remote ls command. I confirmed the site was accessible through the EC2 public IP and that pushing a new commit automatically triggered a fresh deployment.

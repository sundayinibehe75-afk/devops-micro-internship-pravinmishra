# Assignment 04 — Deploy Mini Finance on Azure Using Terraform and Ansible

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will provision Azure infrastructure using Terraform and deploy the Mini Finance website using an Ansible multi-play playbook.

Terraform will create the Azure Virtual Machine and networking resources. Ansible will install Nginx, clone the Mini Finance repository, deploy the website, and verify the deployment.

# Task 1 — Create the Project Structure

## Goal

Create separate directories and files for the Terraform infrastructure and Ansible configuration.

### Evidence

# Task 4 — Ansible — Multi-Play: Install → Deploy → Verify

## Goal

Create `ansible/inventory.ini` and a three-play `site.yml` that installs Nginx and Git, clones and deploys the Mini Finance repository to `/var/www/html/` with a reload handler, and verifies HTTP 200 from `localhost`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Editor showing `inventory.ini` and the three plays in `site.yml`

# Task 5 — Test End-to-End Functionality

## Goal

Confirm the Mini Finance site is publicly accessible and correctly served by Nginx.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Browser showing the Mini Finance site loaded from `http://<public_ip>` with the URL visible

### Notes

Describe an issue you faced and how you fixed it, and what you learned.

I faced a "Host Key Verification" block while using Ansible in WSL because the automated tool couldn't interactively accept the new AWS server's security signature. I resolved it by setting ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False in the configuration files to safely bypass the manual handshake. This taught me that automated DevOps tools require non-interactive environments to run properly, making environment-specific path translations and silent configurations essential for smooth infrastructure deployment

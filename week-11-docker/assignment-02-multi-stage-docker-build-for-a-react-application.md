# Assignment 2 — Multi-Stage Docker Build for a React Application

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will build both a single-stage and an optimized multi-stage Docker image for a React application, compare the resulting image sizes, and deploy the optimized version using a production-ready Nginx runtime container.

Complete this assignment locally on your own computer where Docker is installed and running.

---

# Task 1 — Prepare the Project

## Goal

Prepare the React application for Docker image creation.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Contents of the `.dockerignore` File

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
cat .dockerignore
```

The file must exclude `node_modules`, `build`, and `.env`.

# Task 2 — Create a Single-Stage Docker Image

## Goal

Create a baseline single-stage Docker image and run the application on port 3000.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Contents of `Dockerfile.single`

Add a screenshot showing the completed `Dockerfile.single`.

#### Screenshot 3 — Single-Stage Application in Browser

Add a screenshot of the browser showing the application at:

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Ensure that your full name is visible in the application.

# Task 3 — Create a Multi-Stage Docker Build

## Goal

Create an optimized multi-stage Docker image with separate builder and Nginx runtime stages, then run the application on port 80.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Contents of the Multi-Stage Dockerfile

Add a screenshot showing the completed multi-stage `Dockerfile`.

#### Screenshot 5 — Multi-Stage Application in Browser

Add a screenshot of the browser showing the application at:

```text
http://localhost
```

Ensure that your full name is visible in the application.

# Task 4 — Compare Docker Image Sizes

## Goal

Compare the single-stage and multi-stage image sizes and calculate the percentage reduction.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Docker Image Size Comparison

Add a screenshot of the terminal showing:

```bash
docker images
```

The output must include both:

```text
react-single:latest
react-multistage:latest
```

---

### Percentage Reduction Calculation

Record the image sizes and calculate the reduction using the same unit for both images.

```text
Single-stage image size: 505MB

Multi-stage image size: 26.6MB

Percentage reduction =
((Single-stage image size − Multi-stage image size)
÷ Single-stage image size) × 100

Percentage reduction: 94.7%
```

---

# Task 5 — Analyze the Optimization Results

## Goal

Evaluate the advantages of using multi-stage Docker builds.

### Notes

Write a short analysis of 5–8 lines covering:

- The single-stage and multi-stage image sizes
- The percentage reduction in image size
- Security benefits of the smaller runtime image
- How a smaller runtime image reduces the attack surface
- How smaller images improve image pull and deployment speed
- One Docker build-caching optimization you used

The single-stage image was 505MB, while the multi-stage image was only 26.6MB, a 94.7% reduction in size. The single-stage image shipped Node.js, npm, the full node_modules folder, and the source code, none of which are needed to serve a built React app. The multi-stage build uses a Node builder stage only to compile the app, then copies just the static build output into a small Nginx runtime image. Because the runtime image contains no Node.js, npm, build tools, or development dependencies, it has far fewer packages that could contain vulnerabilities, which reduces the attack surface. A smaller image is also faster to push, pull, and start, so deployments and scaling are quicker and use less bandwidth and storage. For build caching, I copied package.json and package-lock.json and ran npm ci before copying the rest of the source code, so Docker reuses the cached dependency layer when only the application code changes.

# Task 6 — Explore Additional Production Optimizations (Optional)

## Goal

Explore one or more additional production optimization techniques.

### Optional Work

You may choose to:

- Configure an Nginx health check
- Configure cache headers for static assets
- Experiment with a lighter runtime image
- Compare the resulting image size with your original multi-stage image

Screenshots are optional.

# LinkedIn Requirement

## Goal

Create a LinkedIn post describing what you built, what a multi-stage Docker build is, the image-size reduction achieved, and key learnings from the assignment.

### Evidence

#### LinkedIn Post URL

Paste your LinkedIn post URL here:
